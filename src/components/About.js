        I am currently a student at AUCA (Adventist University of Central Africa) almost in last semester, in major of Software engineering with grand distinction. I gained more experience during university coursesâ€™ projects and external resources in my studies.

        During my academic journey, I acquired knowledge of finding solutions to different problems even unfamiliar problems through doing research and commitment, which led me to always succeed and achieve my goals.

        I would describe myself as someone disciplined, courageous with enthusiasm to learn new things in short time, working in team and develop my ability to be more productive to achieve more. I would like to put these characteristics in use within my responsibility and offer my contribution with a commitment to the organization.
